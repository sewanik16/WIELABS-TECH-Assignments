1. A strobogrammatic number is a positive number that appears the same after being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 16891 is strobogrammatic.
Create a program that finds all strobogrammatic numbers with N digits.

2. Given a clock time in hh:mm format, determine, to the nearest degree, the angle between the hour and the minute hands.
Bonus: When, during the course of a day, will the angle be zero?

3. Given an array and a number k that's smaller than the length of the array, rotate the array to the right k elements in-place.
`
4. Given two strings A and B, return whether or not A can be shifted some number of times to get B.
For example, if A is abcde and B is cdeab, return true. If A is abc and B is acb, return false.

5. Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.
For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7.

6. A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.
Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.
For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.

7. Given an array of integers out of order, determine the bounds of the smallest window that must be sorted in order for the entire array to be sorted. For example, given [3, 7, 5, 6, 9], you should return (1, 3).
 
8. Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49
 
9. The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.
For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}
 
10. Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".
Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.
